My interests span across a wide range of tech areas, including distributed data storage technologies, IoT firmware development, cloud architecture, and AI model engineering. I enjoy tinkering in my free time, although it's less often than I'd like. Many of these projects serve as opportunities for me to enhance my skills and delve into new knowledge, although not all of them are finished :)
